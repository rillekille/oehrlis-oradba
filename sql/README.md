# OraDBA SQL Tools and Reporting
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
## General Information

A number of SQL scripts as well as SQL Developer Reports for various DBA
activities are available in this directory. The scripts focus on setup,
configuration and analysis of database security topics such as Oracle Unified
Audit, Oracle Centrally Managed Users, Advanced Security, Authentication,
Authorisation, Encryption and more.. An updated version of the scripts is
available via GitHub on [oehrli/oradba](https://github.com/oehrlis/oradba).

## Naming Concept Summary

### Script Naming Convention

The script names follow the format:
`<script_qualifier><privileges_qualifier><topic_qualifier>_<use_case>.sql`

### Script Qualifier

The script qualifier is used to determine whether a script is used to read
information or to configure, e.g. create, modify, activate, etc.

| Qualifier | Stands For | Comment                                  |
|-----------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| s         | Show       | Output only on screen                    |
| d         | Delete     | Delete any objects, configuration etc    |
| i         | Initialize | Initializes or enable a configuration    |
| c         | Create     | Create any objects, configuration etc.   |
| u         | Update     | Update any object                        |
| g         | Grant      | Grants some objects or system privileges |

### Privileges Qualifier

The privilege qualifier is used to determine what privileges are required by a
script.

| Qualifier | Stands For | Comment                                                                 |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s         | SYS        | SYS, SYSDBA, SYSKM, SYSDG, SYSBACKUP or Internal. Depending on use case |
| d         | DBA        | SYSTEM or any other user with DBA role                                  |
| o         | Owner      | Object owner                                                            |
| p         | Create     | Needs some special privileges according to the scripts inline comments  |
| a         | Audit      | Audit roles like AUDIT_ADMIN or AUDIT_VIEWER                            |

### Topic Qualifier

Topic Qualifier is used to assign the different scripts to a certain topic and
thus to be able to sort them better.

| Qualifier | Stands For        | Comment                                        |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ua        | Unified Audit     | Everything related to Oracle Unified Audit     |
| ta        | Traditional Audit | Everything related to Oracle traditional Audit |
| sec       | Security          | Oracle security related stuff                  |
| enc       | Encryption        | Oracle Transparent DataEncryption              |
| a         | Admin             | Database Administration                        |

## Generic DBA Activities

The following SQL scripts are available.

| Script                     | Alias              | Purpose                                      |
